## Key Features and Implementation Details

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The platform implements a comprehensive RBAC system with four user roles: USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, and SUPER_ADMIN. The implementation includes:

- Client-side RBAC with the `RoleBasedAccess` component and `useRoleAccess` hook
- Server-side RBAC with middleware and controller implementations
- Role hierarchy enforcement

For implementation details, see [ROLE_BASED_ACCESS.md](./ROLE_BASED_ACCESS.md) and [SERVER_SIDE_RBAC_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./SERVER_SIDE_RBAC_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

### Error Handling

The platform includes a robust error handling system with:

- Standardized error objects with the `AppError` class
- Error categorization and severity levels
- Error tracking integration
- UI components for displaying errors
- Network retry functionality with exponential backoff

For implementation details, see [ERROR_HANDLING.md](./ERROR_HANDLING.md).

### Data Export

The platform supports exporting data in multiple formats:

- CSV export
- JSON export
- Excel export
- UI components for triggering exports

For implementation details, see [EXPORT_FUNCTIONALITY.md](./EXPORT_FUNCTIONALITY.md).

### Analytics Dashboard

The analytics dashboard provides visualizations for:

- User growth
- Subscription metrics
- Revenue trends
- Active users

All analytics components support data export functionality.

### Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing suite:

- Unit tests for hooks and utilities
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for complex features

Tests are organized in the `/tests` and `/__tests__` directories.

## Implementation Priorities

The current implementation priorities are:

1. Apply database migration and run user role update script
2. Add audit logging for access attempts
3. Add real-time updates via WebSockets
4. Enhance mobile responsiveness of admin interfaces
5. Complete placeholder components
6. Improve data visualization components
7. Optimize performance for large data sets
8. Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

For a detailed breakdown, see [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js with custom React wrappers
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Error Handling**: Custom error handling system with error tracking
- **Data Export**: Custom utilities for CSV, JSON, and Excel export

For a complete list, see the Tech Stack section in [AUDIT.md](./AUDIT.md).

## Database Migrations

The project includes a migration for adding the role field to the User model. This migration needs to be applied when database access is available:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

After applying the migration, run the user role update script:

```bash
npm run update-user-roles
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Dependencies

If you encounter missing dependency errors, try:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Testing Issues

For testing issues related to React Testing Library, ensure you're using the correct imports:

```javascript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

### RBAC Implementation

When implementing new admin features, remember to:

1. Wrap components with the `RoleBasedAccess` component
2. Protect API endpoints with the `roleAuth` middleware
3. Update tests to account for role-based access
