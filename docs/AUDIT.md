## Admin Functionality Audit

### Admin Service Structure
- Located in `src/services/AdminService.ts`
- Defines user roles: USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN
- Defines user statuses: ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, BANNED, PENDING
- Includes interfaces for User, PlatformStats, ContentReport, SystemSettings
- Provides filtering capabilities for users and reports

### Admin Dashboard
- Main component in `src/pages/admin/Dashboard.tsx`
- Tab-based interface with sections for:
  - Analytics
  - User Management
  - Verification Queue
  - Security Logs
- Maintains active tab state and renders corresponding components
- Implements role-based access control to restrict access to authorized users

### Admin Components
The following components were identified in `src/components/admin/`:
- PermissionManager.tsx (5.9KB) - Handles user permissions and role assignments
- SubscriptionAnalytics.tsx (7.6KB) - Visualizes subscription data and trends
- VerificationQueue.tsx (15KB) - Manages verification requests
- VerificationQueueManagement.tsx (9.9KB) - Advanced verification queue features
- SecurityAlertManagement.tsx (9.6KB) - Handles security alerts and notifications
- SecurityLogViewer.tsx (12KB) - Displays security logs with filtering
- AdminDashboard.tsx (7.2KB) - Main admin dashboard component
- Dashboard.tsx (8.7KB) - Dashboard layout and navigation
- RoleBasedAccess.tsx (NEW) - Component for role-based access control
- BrokerageFeeManagement.tsx (102B) - Placeholder for brokerage fee features
- ReviewModeration.tsx (102B) - Placeholder for review moderation
- VerificationAdmin.tsx (605B) - Admin controls for verification process

### Role-Based Access Control
- Implemented a comprehensive role-based access control system
- Created a reusable RoleBasedAccess component for declarative access control
- Developed a useRoleAccess hook for programmatic access control in functional components
- Integrated with the existing authentication system
- Applied role-based access control to all admin components:
  - Dashboard.tsx - Requires ADMIN role
  - SubscriptionAnalytics.tsx - Requires ADMIN role
  - VerificationQueue.tsx - Requires MODERATOR role
  - SecurityLogViewer.tsx - Requires ADMIN role
  - PermissionManager.tsx - Requires SUPER_ADMIN role
- Added documentation in docs/ROLE_BASED_ACCESS.md
- Implemented server-side role-based middleware:
  - Created roleAuth.ts middleware for API endpoint protection
  - Updated admin routes to use role-based middleware
  - Added role field to User model in Prisma schema
  - Implemented consistent role hierarchy between client and server
  - Applied appropriate role requirements to different admin endpoints:
    - /admin/dashboard - Requires ADMIN role
    - /admin/verification-requests - Requires MODERATOR role
    - /admin/security-logs - Requires ADMIN role
  - Fixed Prisma schema validation issues
  - Created manual migration file for the role field
  - Created script to update existing users with appropriate roles
- Added comprehensive testing for RBAC components and hooks:
  - Unit tests for useRoleAccess hook
  - Component tests for RoleBasedAccess component
  - Integration tests for the entire RBAC system

### Error Handling System

  - Unit tests for hooks and utilities
  - Component tests for UI components
  - Integration tests for complex features
- Implemented tests for key features:
  - Role-based access control
  - Export functionality
  - Error handling
  - Analytics components
- Used modern testing practices:
  - Jest for test runner and assertions
