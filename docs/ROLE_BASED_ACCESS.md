# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the role-based access control (RBAC) implementation for the Launchify Web Platform. The RBAC system ensures that only users with appropriate permissions can access specific features and functionality within the application, particularly in the admin dashboard.

## User Roles

The platform defines the following user roles in a hierarchical structure:

1. **SUPER_ADMIN**: Highest level of access with complete control over all platform features
2. **ADMIN**: Administrative access to manage users, content, and platform settings
3. **MODERATOR**: Limited administrative access for content moderation and verification
4. **USER**: Standard user access for regular platform functionality

Each role inherits the permissions of the roles below it in the hierarchy.

## Implementation Components

### 1. RoleBasedAccess Component

Located at `src/components/admin/RoleBasedAccess.tsx`, this component provides a declarative way to restrict access to UI components based on user roles.

```tsx
<RoleBasedAccess requiredRole={UserRole.ADMIN} fallback={<AccessDenied />}>
  <AdminDashboard />
</RoleBasedAccess>
```

The component:
- Checks if the current user has the required role or higher
- Renders the children if the user has access
- Renders the fallback component if the user doesn't have access

### 2. useRoleAccess Hook

Located at `src/hooks/useRoleAccess.ts`, this custom hook provides a programmatic way to check role-based access within functional components.

```tsx
const { hasAccess, isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useRoleAccess(UserRole.ADMIN);

if (!hasAccess) {
  return <AccessDenied />;
}
```

The hook returns:
- `hasAccess`: Boolean indicating if the user has the required role
- `isLoading`: Boolean indicating if the authentication state is still loading
- `isAuthenticated`: Boolean indicating if the user is authenticated

### 3. Integration with Authentication

The RBAC system integrates with the existing authentication system through the `useAuth` hook, which provides the user's role information.

## Usage Guidelines

### Protecting Admin Components

All admin components should be wrapped with the `RoleBasedAccess` component or use the `useRoleAccess` hook to ensure proper access control.

### Role Hierarchy

When determining required roles for features, follow these guidelines:

- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Reserved for critical system operations (user deletion, system settings)
- **ADMIN**: Used for most administrative functions (analytics, user management)
- **MODERATOR**: Used for content moderation and verification tasks
- **USER**: Default role for authenticated users

### API Protection

In addition to client-side RBAC, all sensitive API endpoints must implement server-side role checks to ensure security.

## Example Implementation

### Dashboard Component

```tsx
import RoleBasedAccess from '@/components/admin/RoleBasedAccess';
import { UserRole } from '@/services/AdminService';

const AdminDashboard = () => {
  // Component implementation
};

export default () => (
  <RoleBasedAccess requiredRole={UserRole.ADMIN}>
    <AdminDashboard />
  </RoleBasedAccess>
);
```

### Functional Component with Hook

```tsx
import { useRoleAccess } from '@/hooks/useRoleAccess';
import { UserRole } from '@/services/AdminService';

const AnalyticsComponent = () => {
  const { hasAccess } = useRoleAccess(UserRole.ADMIN);
  
  if (!hasAccess) {
    return <AccessDenied />;
  }
  
  // Component implementation
};
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Permission-Based Access Control**: Extend the system to support granular permissions beyond roles
2. **Role Assignment UI**: Develop an interface for SUPER_ADMINs to assign roles to users
3. **Audit Logging**: Implement logging for role changes and access attempts
4. **Role-Based Navigation**: Dynamically adjust navigation based on user roles
