# Access Control System Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the access control system implementation for the Launchify platform, which includes:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Subscription tier permissions
- Resource ownership verification
- Verification level access controls

## Features
- Fine-grained permission control based on subscription tiers
- Verification level requirements for specific features
- Resource ownership validation
- Performance-optimized with Redis caching
- Middleware for easy route protection

## Integration Guide

### 1. Protecting Routes

#### Feature Access Based on Subscription
```typescript
import { requireFeatureAccess } from '@/middleware/accessControl';

// Basic route protection
router.get('/analytics',
  requireFeatureAccess('read_basic_analytics'),
  analyticsController.getBasicAnalytics
);
```

### 2. Subscription Tier Permissions

The system defines permissions for each subscription tier:

- **Basic**
  - Read basic profile information
  - View basic matches
  
- **Chrome**
  - All Basic permissions
  - Access basic analytics
  - View Chrome-tier matches
  
- **Bronze**
  - All Chrome permissions
  - Access advanced analytics
  - View Bronze-tier matches
  
- **Silver**
  - All Bronze permissions
  - Priority support access
  - View Silver-tier matches
  
- **Gold**
  - All Silver permissions
  - Profile boost feature
  - View Gold-tier matches
  
- **Platinum**
  - All Gold permissions
  - White glove service
  - View all matches
  - Unlimited feature access

### 3. Error Handling

The system provides specific error responses:

```json
// Feature access denied
{
  "message": "This feature requires a higher subscription tier"
}

// Verification level required
{
  "message": "This feature requires additional verification"
}

// Resource access denied
{
  "message": "You do not have access to this resource"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Layered Security**
   - Always combine authentication with access control
   - Use multiple middleware layers when needed
   - Validate at both route and service levels

2. **Performance**
   - Utilize Redis caching for frequent access checks
   - Invalidate cache strategically
   - Use batch operations when possible

3. **Error Handling**
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Log access denials for monitoring
   - Include enough context for debugging

4. **Testing**
   - Write tests for each permission level
   - Test cache invalidation
   - Verify resource ownership checks
